    <!-- 8. Define a class `Car` with private attributes `model`, `year`, and `speed`. Encapsulate these attributes using
    appropriate access specifiers. Implement public member functions to set and get the values of these attributes.
    Demonstrate encapsulation by accessing these attributes through the member functions. -->
