# 🔊 Text to Speech Web App

A stylish and interactive **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** web app using JavaScript’s Web Speech API. It allows users to convert typed text into spoken words with features like **word-by-word highlighting**, **pause/resume**, **clear**, and **language toggle (English ↔ Gujarati)**.
